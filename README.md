# RenPy-TV

A WIP RenPy visual-novel that uses TV channels as the source material.

TODO:
- Better subs detection
- Implement some code blocks more efficiently
- Reverse subs based on language + move reverse to server
- Multiclient handling? Currently every user runs both processes, could be a waste to not share resources
- Add cool manipulations
